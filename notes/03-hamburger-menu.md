# hamburger menu

- outer div (going to put it into the titlebar)
- one div, have it fixed to the left-hand side 
- I think I can use a hamburger image .svg and load it into the div
    - I think this uses the `<img>` tag...
    - oh! what was that website with all of the icons that Stephen shared?
- when I click it, I want a vertical list of divs to appear
    - I want this list to overlap any other divs on the page, and to not move the content.
