`ul`:

- unordered list

How to get each div within an outer div to be the same width?

- use `flex-1` on each inner div!
- combine this with `text-center`

`flex`:

- this aligns items in a row (!!)

`justify-between`:

- this allows you to have some divs on the left and some divs on the right within a flex div.
- this is in contrast to `justify-center` which helps to spread things evenly across the div.
- the first is pushed to the start, and the last to the end. Other divs will be spaced evenly between them (!!)

`cursor-pointer`:

- changes the cursor into a hand when hovering over an element, indicating it's clickable.

`w-full`:

- makes an element take up the full width of its parent container.

`mb`:
-
