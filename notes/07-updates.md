# Updates to make soon

1. make overall text smaller
   -- I think this is a bad idea, just apply it to components individually?
2. make dropdown take up less of the page
3.

# flex-col

- this allows divs to stack vertically (!!)

# inline-block

- make it so text only takes up needed space

# Button stuff

`npm install classnames`
`npm install tailwind-merge`
